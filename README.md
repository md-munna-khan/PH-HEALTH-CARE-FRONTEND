- login sets the cookie and then using the token we will fetch the user details from the backend. and we will do it like we will grab the user data and keep in a `state` and wrap everything using a provider so that everywhere accessible. 
- install jwt-decode package using `npm i jwt-decode`

- proxy.ts

}

/**
 * A minimal role -> allowed routes mapping. If you add routes here,

/**
 * Middleware-like proxy function used by Next.js routing. It enforces:
 * - Redirect to `/login` when no tokens are present and the route is protected
 * - Decoding of the access token to determine user role
 * - If the access token is missing/expired but a refresh token exists,
 *   it calls the backend refresh endpoint to attempt to obtain a new access token
 * - Role-based route authorization (redirect to `/unauthorized` when not allowed)
 * - Prevent logged-in users from seeing auth pages (redirect to `/`)
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - request: NextRequest provided by Next.js
 *
 * Outputs:
 * - NextResponse.redirect(...) to move the user to login/unauthorized
 * - NextResponse.next() to allow the request through
 *
 * Error modes:
 * - On token decoding or refresh errors the user is redirected to `/login`
